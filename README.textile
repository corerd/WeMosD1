h2. Using GitHub Pages

On any regular repository, the *gh-pages* branch has a special meaning for GitHub: any content pushed here, will automatically published to the project GitHub Pages.

The instructions can be found at "Creating Project Pages manually":https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually.

Since "git 1.7.10":https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/418 (April 2012) git allows you to clone only one branch by means of the new `--single-branch` option.
